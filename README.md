# p5.js Tetris

A remake of the classic game, just for fun. Written in JavaScript (ES6) using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

This particular remake is in the style of a student project, which you can find at https://github.com/PGeyer127/Tetris

For my own educational experience, I've rewritten the whole thing, but kept the vision and style of @eestevens7 and @PGeyer127.

Deep into the rework I decided to make my changes explicit in the commit log,
such that they hopefully can show some insight into the iterative process and
maybe serve as a reference to students.
